# PowerBi_ATM cash flow 

This ATM Cash Flow Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of cash management in ATMs, tracking both cash inflow and outflow over time. This tool helps ATM managers and financial teams predict and ensure optimal cash levels, prevent shortages or surpluses, and monitor overall ATM performance.

## Data Sources
The data is pulled from ATM transaction records, cash replenishment logs, and historical usage patterns. It updates automatically as new transaction data becomes available, ensuring real-time monitoring and decision-making.
